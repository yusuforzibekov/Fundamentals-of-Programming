# Count Words
The purpose of this exercise is to learn how to use Map collections.


Duration: **45 minutes**



## Description

In this task, you will calculate how often each word occurs in a text and get the corresponding statistics. Omit all words that contain fewer than **four** letters and appear fewer than **10** times (words that are too small or rare).  

Please proceed to the `Words` class and provide the implementations of the `countWords()` method, which returns the statistics as a String containing entries in the form ` "word - amount\n" `. 

### Details
* The input parameter is a list of strings representing lines of text.  
* The entries in the resulting String should also be sorted by descending frequency of words    and then in alphabetical order if necessary.  
* Make sure your code can handle texts in English and other languages.   

## Restrictions
You may not use streams, lambdas, or method references in your code.
