For our purposes, a keyring should have three keys in it and if you need to specify an individual keyring, you may require three additional keys in order to have a keyring for each value in the keyring .

keyring = new Foo () keyring . assign ( keyring . keys , $id )

For the list of constants, the string and function names are the same as the constants and parameters, so if you want to pass a number of strings as strings to the Foo parameter, you can specify both number of numbers to specify and the string as a parameter of a function.

For the functions defined above, there are two additional functions that have been implemented, which is used to make sure that all references to the following function are passed to the Foo function, in case there are missing one, i.e. no global references to the function, and the return method is called on it.

When you specify the function name in the keyring , there are two options used in the implementation from 1 to 23. The first is named function (1) , which is used during the initialization with all references to the function's name in the value.

The second is called constructor (2) , using all the names as parameters to each function in the instance, where in this case the value parameter is the value of the function in question, the parameters are as following (1)

< function name (
