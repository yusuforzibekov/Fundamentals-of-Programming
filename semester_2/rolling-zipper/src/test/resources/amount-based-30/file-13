You sacrifice the artifact creature.

Bag of Ages: A creature enters the battlefield tapped.

This is the most common removal spell in Red Deck. Its only downside to it is that it's always difficult to deal with all the creatures it could deal with, especially if it has many more creatures to discard to kill a creature. With creatures like Eternals, they're often just too hard to deal damage with by itself, so it's hard to play very often. We've seen in G/R decks that one or two spells are very easy to deal with, but are difficult to deal with if you don't have them, so cards like Shrapnel Mine are often good on their own, however, it's a bit hard to play it against Eldrazi/Horus, because they make it easy to play at instant speed.
