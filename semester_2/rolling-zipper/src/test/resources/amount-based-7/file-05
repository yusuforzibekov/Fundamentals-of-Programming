While visiting home in Neelix, Spock is pursued by an alien that has captured them from within and the two are reunited in their travels. An uneasy Kirk arrives, but they cannot find him. Spock decides to investigate, and while waiting for the police ship he is attacked by the creature. Captain Kirk then enters the room and discovers that it is Kirk, Spock, and two others, and he is left to wonder about their past and what may have been in their minds. Kirk then takes the body inside of a room while Spock tries to locate it, and finds a pair of bodies on the floor, with Spock trying to find them out by digging.
