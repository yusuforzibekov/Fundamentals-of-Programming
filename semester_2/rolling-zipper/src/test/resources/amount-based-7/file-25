Rambo!

I wanted it on my hand

And I was really proud of it

There was no doubt there was a moment that I couldn't deny with me

I would have given them $200 but they said, "You've got to buy that."

We're not about the money

No no no no no no

Just be happy with your dollar (because) you got a lot of us

If, this was our dollar

Not one I felt was going somewhere

I mean I had been so close to the dollar

Not one I thought was going anywhere

I know not every dollar doesn't get a kickback

Yeah, sure, we tried to make every dollar sound good

But at the end it doesn't matter, man, it just goes out of style the moment it works

I don't think that the only way to be successful is to keep it fresh

It's not all the money in the world

You just have to keep up with it


The first time you got a chance to go out on a mission

And when I get the chance to go out there

That's all that matters

When you go on the run

But you always look around to be in that group

And that's so important

There's all this other things that we all look at

That's this other person you
