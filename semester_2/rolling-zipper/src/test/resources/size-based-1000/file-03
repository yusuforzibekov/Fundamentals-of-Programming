Java, using Rust in C# and Cocoa, the same compiler, just a little bit harder to find a way to get you to where you want to work. Let the world know that it is using Rust. The end result is beautiful.

Conclusion

Rust is a simple, but effective programming language for all kinds of problems.

Its core features (code completion, async, lazy evaluation) allow you to learn more with ease than ever before, no matter how many times you need to create your project.

Also, let's not forget that Rust is an IDE (an IDE for programs built using standard library code). Yes if you need to write test data from a Visual IDE, then Rust is for you. Yes if you want to make your own C-style interactive projects, Rust is for you.

That is why we like the IDE and IDE. For the beginner, use Rust for beginners to learn. For those who want to learn the language for beginners and want to do code analysis, for those wanting to work in C++ in a world built by humans, then Rust is the IDE for you.

If someone asks where to start, the choice would be Rust.
