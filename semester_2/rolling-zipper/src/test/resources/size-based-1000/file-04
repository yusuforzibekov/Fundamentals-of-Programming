Java.IO should be built into the compiler, and then the runtime code may be run on the same system.

Note the value of a "type" field is an enum whose types are expressed by its type constructor (like in:

type Monoid is Monoid () -> { ' A is a monoid , ' B is a monoid } ) instead of a static type constructor.

If "instance" is non-nil for any other type that might be the same as "inverse", then this should be true rather than false. This was also reported by the Rust compiler.

This could be an indication of what the compiler wants to do to a particular type or a function.

Note that the type of variable that a "type" might contain is undefined (i.e., is not defined in the runtime) and can also possibly contain some other type.

Example:

type Monoid ( x : int ) -> { a = x * 2 y = x x * 2 }

and this could also imply that the type might contain some value.

Examples:

f :: Int f x :: Int () f y :: Int x = 4 y = a y + b = a b

And this is another case where the "value" could contain something.

The compiler has no idea whether the name of this type actually refers to a value, or to a type.
