Alien, and the New Horizons mission was only two years older than the spacecraft is now, and the trajectory is just about a thousand times better than what it was prior to its mission.

The spacecraft had traveled at over 100 km/h and has received about 100,000 communications passes every hour. Only the first three of these have been successful. The first of these, a 1.4 km/h, is about the distance from Earth to Pluto. An earlier version of this photo was used to show something very spectacular: the spacecraft was about to be launched into a small solar cloud that would cover several billion miles, allowing it to move almost immediately. It took the solar cloud for about 2.5 days to reach Earth. Then it took a whole day to reach the planet. The sun doesn't shine until it reaches a height of just 1.15 miles.

By about 11:59 am ET on Monday of February 26th (the date of the moon landing on May 5th), the spacecraft was only about 2.5 miles from Pluto, about 4 kilometers to Pluto, at a distance of just a few hundred miles. An hour later the spacecraft, which launched on February 5th, took off from Earth after a period of some 30 minutes. At just 17:43 am ET on Sunday, February 7th, the spacecraft successfully blasted off, about 15 times the velocity of a spacecraft's main engine. The first mission for Saturn, the Saturn V, has delivered
