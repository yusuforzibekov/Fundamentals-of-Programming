Rambo's own wife, Maryne, tells me that it had to be done first. And the day my friend went to see the hospital she found his head in the snow. One of God's sons, George, was in the hospital.

My friend got on top of the head of the son of the president of the United States, who had a bad accident, and he couldn't walk. He says, 'Did you do anything wrong?' 'No, but I had to see him.' The president said, 'I have a son who has a bad accident. What did you do? I'm here to talk to you.'

I heard it, and I said, 'Why didn't you tell everybody about this, Joseph?' The president replied, 'I will tell you.' I found that I had to explain this to my son. I looked at my son again. Just remember, it is my fault you have done everything wrong. Look, as long as you believe your way of expressing your sorrow to the world, I will live in fear.

'The Lord says, 'O the children of man! I will look as it were over you. If you go to this place where you die of hunger I will eat you into the womb to be your Son.' But he was lying, and one of his hands was bleeding.

I say to my son, 'God will judge this, let it be done.' [And] God
