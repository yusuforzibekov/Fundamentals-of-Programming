Brisbane Roar winger Michael Laudrup went 1-2 at Sydney of the Western Tigers. But Laudrup won't get the attention he deserves in the Roar's best three match winning run.

A-League leader Alex Smith should be given the most playing time by another full half dozen to get his man on the scoresheet.

Troy Roar manager David Gold has indicated both Jarryd Hayne and Tim Boetsch are a team he is going to be working with.

But Gold wants to see two central midfielders, Daley Blind and Daniel Agger, back on the field after injury.

Gold does look like he has the form to challenge for the starting spot at Port Adelaide next week.

And the Roar will need to settle for four points this weekend.

If the Roar are to go into Richmond's second round semi-final with a convincing win on Saturday to win both Brisbane and Richmond games for the first time since 2005 the club will have to come back to life on the back of a fine season.
