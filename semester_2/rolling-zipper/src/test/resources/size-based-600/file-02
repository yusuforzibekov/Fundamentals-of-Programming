This project aims to provide an easy alternative to the standard Python implementation of your application (it doesn't have any code generation tools, but you can use the "python-mumble", "python-python" or "python-gimp" files to make Python work. Just create a new file and run:

./python-gimp

This will create a file named python-gmumble.py in your project root.

Paleo Python Documentation

Paleo.com is a wiki for both Python and its syntax (including the documentation).

If you already have Python installed, get up from under the directory where you installed it. Or, alternatively clone and install python-python and Python.

You need to create a new directory, use a subdirectory, and hit F5 (make sure it's named after the filename you'd like to reference).

If you're installing it manually, then just use the root directory to install Python.

The Python module system is here: PEP 758. It currently is available there, it's the same API as the Python interpreter itself.

The Python module base contains more than 3000 filetypes.
